      <h2>About</h2>
      <p> Hey there!

          My name is Chaikal Amrullah, I am a master student at
          Geodesy and Geoinformation, Technical University of Munich, Germany.

          First of all, thank you for participating in the trial of this app.
          This application was made as part of the Project Cartography coursework (Winter Semester 2021/2022)\n
          with the title "Building a Design-It-Yourself Navigation Web App Interface".
          The application is made to find out user preferences related to
          symbol design for navigation applications on Augmented Reality (AR) devices.
          Symbols that can be easily understood by users are expected
          to increase user comfort in using the device and can make it easier
          for users to remember travel routes.
          Before you start, make sure you watch the app usage guide.
          The application user guide video can be seen at the following link... .
